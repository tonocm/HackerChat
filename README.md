####HackerChat allows you to create a great hackathon team, maximizing the opportunity for learning, communicating, and hacking!


Hackers may not always take full advantage the hackathon experience.
The root of this problems lies on how the process is normally run:
- Hackers join a social media group, usually on Facebook
- Organizers post updates of the event to the group
- Hackers express their excitement and sometimes post a vague description of their ideas on the group
- Due to the nature of the social networks, it is hard for hackers to find people with specific skillsets or a set of ideas.
- When hackers make an effort to find teammates with specific qualifications, their posts usually get lost within other social interactions, such as the ones mentioned above.

With this current process, none of the core components of a hackathon, learning, creating, and communicating are being maximized. Hackers usually wait until the beginning of the event to find a team; which usually leads to the formation of a team with a random set of abilities. Inheritely, due to a lack of technological diversity, there exists a limitation on the  for learning. This restricts creativity and overall performance, relative to a well-planned team.

Furthermore, once the event gets started, there is no effective communication medium to exchange thoughts, ideas, and informal conversations.

Our solution is to provide a service that includes a standard communication platform and a teammate matchmaking service based on the abilities a person can provide, and those he or she needs.

#####HackerChat allows for the original purpose of hackatons to be accomplished.

It enables users to access the service with easy authentication, automatically provides team members suggestions through a **complementary-ability matching algorithm**, and enables instant messaging based on a person's current location.

This permits all hackers to communicate freely in a chat room, without the need to trade their personal information and find people with complementary abilities, maximizing their team's potential.
